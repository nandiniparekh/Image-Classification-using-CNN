# Image-Classification-using-CNN
Developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) utilizing the LeNet architecture with contemporary adaptations, employing TensorFlow and Keras libraries for image classification on the MNIST Digits dataset. Engineered a specialized model featuring ReLU activation, MAX() pooling, and a softmax classification layer, and conducted extensive parameter exploration through stratified cross-validation, resulting in optimized configurations for superior image recognition performance.
